# Paper Surveys
Thanks to @Dmytrii S., there is another version forcused on  [Machine Learning Surveys](https://github.com/metrofun/machine-learning-surveys)

This is a record of research papers of computer vision and machine learning that I have read. The sharing principle of these references here is for research. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact me.

You are more than welcome to update this list! 
If you find a paper about computer vision and machine learning is not listed here, or the classification is not appropriate, please

- fork this repository, add it and merge back;
- or report an issue here.
